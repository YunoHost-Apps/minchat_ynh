## Features

- Simple web chat: only requires a browser ; no XMPP application
- No need for users to register. Just need the web address. But optional authorisation control.
- On connection, the page is fed with the messages of the day
- Args are in the URL as *get* arguments, so that you can share the URL or make it a favorite to avoid filling a form.  
Example : `https://yourdomain.org/minchat/?room=Living&name=John`
- Optionaly multi room

## Installation
#### On Yunohost
Via the admin web console, type in: <https://github.com/chtixof/minchat_ynh>  
Or on ssh : `sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/chtixof/minchat_ynh`

Upgrade: `sudo yunohost app upgrade minchat -u https://github.com/chtixof/minchat_ynh`  

#### Otherwise
Download, unzip and just copy the content of the `sources` folder to any folder of your web site.
## Setup
The setup is optional. If you leave it as is, there is a single unnamed room, opened to all users. If you want to customize the access control, edit the file `conf/setup.ini` (if missing, copy it from `conf/sample/setup.ini`). The interesting parameter is `auth` that indicates which user is authorized to which room.

In this example `auth = John:Game,John:Family,Mary:Game,Tim:Family,admin:*,*:Public,*:`,
- `John:Game,John:Family` = John can access the Game room, the Family room 
- `Mary:Game` = Mary can access the Game room 
- `Tim:Family` = Tim can access the Family room 
- `admin:*` = admin can access all rooms
- `*:Public` = everybody can acccess the Public room
- `*:` = everybody  can access the unnamed room

## Hints for users
- The URLs you send are linked or transformed to images when preceeded by a !
- If multiple rooms are allowed by the administrator in the setup.ini, you can have several tabs opened to different rooms in the same browser
